# Project Title :  Analysis and Predication of "Breast Cancer Diagnosis Using Logistic Regression" to classify breast cancer tumors as either malignant or benign with high accuracy.

# Tools & Technology:
1. Jupyter Notebook
2. Python Programming Language
3. Numpy (Python Library)
4. Pandas(Python Library)
5. Matplot(Python Library)
6. Google Colab

# Problem Statement:
### Breast cancer is a prevalent and potentially life-threatening disease. Early detection is crucial for successful treatment. This project leverages logistic regression and machine learning techniques to predict breast cancer diagnoses based on patient data. The Breast Cancer dataset is used, containing various features extracted from breast cancer biopsies.

### The primary goal is to build a predictive model that can classify breast cancer tumors as either malignant or benign with high accuracy. We preprocess the data by splitting it into training and testing sets and standardizing the features to improve model performance. A logistic regression model is trained on the training data to learn the underlying patterns.

### The project evaluates the model's performance using metrics such as accuracy, confusion matrix, and a classification report. Accurate breast cancer classification can assist medical professionals in making more informed decisions about patient care and treatment options, potentially saving lives through early diagnosis.
